# Spam-Mail-Detector
Build a classifier that distinguishes between spam and non-spam (ham) emails using textual data.

 Dataset: 
Public datasets like the SMS Spam Collection (UCI) or Enron Email Dataset.

 Steps:

o Load the messages and labels (spam or ham).

o Preprocess the text (lowercasing, remove stopwords, tokenization).

o Convert text into numeric features (Bag of Words or TF-IDF).

o Split into train/test sets.

o Train a simple model (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).

o Measure performance with accuracy, precision, or F1 score.

 Skills gained: Text preprocessing, feature extraction, basic NLP, classification.
